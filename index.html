  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Hello, my name is Devin Judson, and I have been in SNHU's Computer Science degree program since August 2021. This page is my final project and ePortfolio for the CS-499 Capstone and marks the completion of my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science.</p>

  <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
  <p>Throughout my time in the Computer Science program, I have grown both academically and professionally. The experience has helped me refine the technical and collaborative skills needed to thrive as a software developer. Creating this ePortfolio has allowed me to showcase the projects I've developed, assess my technical competencies, and reflect on how my education at SNHU has prepared me to contribute meaningfully in the tech industry.

One of the most impactful projects I completed was Travlr Getaways, a full-stack travel management application. I enhanced this project in multiple ways during the capstone, including implementing Angular Material UI for improved design and accessibility, integrating soft-delete functionality to preserve data integrity, and optimizing form validation logic. This demonstrated my growth in both front-end and back-end development and my ability to design maintainable systems.

In the area of algorithms and data structures, I focused on enhancing the computer AI logic of a checkers game. I analyzed the CompTurn decision-making algorithm and introduced a board evaluation strategy that improved the AI’s competitiveness. This demonstrated my ability to critically assess and optimize algorithmic solutions.

Cybersecurity was also an area of focus throughout my studies. From foundational knowledge to practical applications, I developed an understanding of secure coding practices and threat mitigation techniques. Integrating security considerations into my development process is now second nature.

Teamwork and communication were emphasized throughout the program. I've learned how to collaborate effectively using tools like Git, conduct code reviews, and translate technical ideas into presentations for non-technical stakeholders. These experiences have prepared me to work in diverse teams and ensure alignment between business goals and technical implementations.

As I look ahead, I feel confident in my readiness to enter the software development field. My goal is to contribute to music technology platforms like Spotify or Apple Music, combining my love for music and technology. SNHU has given me the foundation I need to keep learning and solving meaningful problems.</p>

  <h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
  <p>In this ePortfolio I will demonstrate the following course outcomes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse teams to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science.</li>
    <li>Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve real-world problems, based on user needs and requirements.</li>
    <li>Communicate clearly and effectively with a range of audiences through technical writing, presentations, and code documentation.</li>
    <li>Develop software systems that integrate security best practices at every stage of the development lifecycle.</li>
    <li>Analyze and apply data structures and algorithms to improve performance and maintainability of software.</li>
    
    <!-- List all outcomes -->
  </ul>

  <!-- Add more sections below as you complete them -->
